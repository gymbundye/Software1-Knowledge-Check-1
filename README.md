The repo required to complete knowledge check one for week 3

Added Multiplication functionality

Had to change/add code in Program.CS AND Calculator.CS

EXTRA CREDIT

Im pretty sure this is asking you to make a class for the Parse for the entered integers that can be re-used for 
each of the operators (addition +,subtraction -,multiplication *,division /). I believe to accomplish this you would 
create a class (Im going to name mine ParseNum) that would accept the num1 and num2, parse them and then pass those values to
whichever operator the user chooses. After I build the class I think I will need to change the variable names to be constant through-
out and not dependant on a case by case basis.
